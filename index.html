<p id = "racial">The fight against racial inequality is important because equality should be a right and not a privilege and those claiming it is a right; they are wrong. People of color are being mistreated horriablely. However, society ignores it. The treatment of the Capital Riot and the Black Lives Matter is one of many examples that racial inequality is a privilage.</p>
